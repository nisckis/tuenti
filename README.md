    Was stuck finding the (correct) echo command...
    
    It turns out that the folder `/game/actions` contains all the avaliable commands/actions. The problem/troll part was that the [speaking head emoji](https://emojipedia.org/speaking-head/) (🗣️ -> bad) is different from the one given in the folder (🗣 -> good). 
    The funny thing is that the other action commands were the same in the folder and the standard (emojipedia, iemoji, Windows emojis, emojiterra, ...) For example the flashlight, was the [actual flashlight emoji](https://emojipedia.org/flashlight/) (🔦).
